# TTS models

The default TTS pipeline loads two GGUFs: a **MagpieTTS** token generator and a **NeMo
NanoCodec** decoder. An opt-in native [OmniVoice](omnivoice.md) pipeline loads
its denoiser and Higgs Audio V2 tokenizer GGUFs instead. The CLI downloads the complete default Magpie stack, including
Magpie's tokenizer assets, with one command:

```bash
nemo-speech pull magpie
nemo-speech synthesize "Hello from Magpie Multilingual." --output output.wav
```

`synthesize` performs the same verified pull automatically when its model
options are omitted.

## MagpieTTS token generator

Hugging Face: [nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m)

```bash
# Download the v2602 GGUF and its matching tokenizer archive from their
# immutable revisions.
hf download nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m \
    --include magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.v2602.f16.gguf \
    --revision 452ef560f972c38d5fc16476259aac9456453547 \
    --local-dir models/magpie-tts
hf download nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m \
    --include magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.nemo \
    --revision 34d7e40da85cabc97f92198889b65cea27bc7fd1 \
    --local-dir models/magpie-tts

# Extract the tokenizer assets loaded by the runtime.
mkdir -p models/magpie-tts/extracted
tar -xf models/magpie-tts/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.nemo \
    -C models/magpie-tts/extracted
```

MagpieTTS v2607 uses factor-2 frame stacking and must currently be converted
locally before use:

```bash
hf download nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m \
    magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.nemo \
    --revision v2607 --local-dir models/magpie-tts-v2607
python3 convert_model.py models/magpie-tts-v2607/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.nemo \
    --outfile models/magpie-tts-v2607/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.v2607.f16.gguf
mkdir -p models/magpie-tts-v2607/extracted
tar -xf models/magpie-tts-v2607/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m.nemo \
    -C models/magpie-tts-v2607/extracted
```

Both v2602 (factor 1) and v2607 (factor 2) use the same NanoCodec decoder.

**Tokenizer.** MagpieTTS's tokenizer assets live *inside* the `.nemo` archive -
they are not part of the GGUF. The built-in pull extracts only the required,
pinned tokenizer members and verifies each one. For a custom Magpie checkpoint,
extract its `.nemo` archive and pass that directory as `--tokenizer-dir` or
`--tts.tokenizer-model-dir`.
The model-specific IPA/text tokenizer assets are loaded from this directory.
The GGUF and extracted directory must come from the same model revision. The
runtime recognizes the exact v2602 and v2607 tokenizer layouts from
`model_config.yaml` and rejects unknown layouts or a profile mismatch at
startup. Newly converted GGUFs record the profile explicitly; older v2602 and
v2607 GGUFs are identified from their text-vocabulary and frame-stacking
dimensions. In particular, v2602 uses the Hindi character tokenizer, while
v2607 uses the bundled Hindi IPA dictionary and also changes tokenizer order,
Japanese ASCII casing, Italian/Vietnamese tokenizer names, and the supported
language set.
Japanese tokenization requires a build with `NEMO_SPEECH_TTS_WITH_JA=ON`
(disabled by default), which builds Open JTalk, MeCab, and the NAIST dictionary.
Mandarin requires `NEMO_SPEECH_TTS_WITH_ZH=ON` (disabled by default) and
additionally uses cppjieba plus pypinyin-compatible tables bundled with the
native runtime. Those tables are stored in Git LFS, so run `git lfs install`
once and `git lfs pull` before configuring this feature. No Python environment
is needed when serving `zh` or `zh-CN`. Run `git lfs pull` in the checkout
before `docker build` as well, because the build context does not include
`.git`.

**Text normalization.** TTS can optionally run Sparrowhawk TN before Magpie
tokenization. Build with `-DNEMO_SPEECH_WITH_NORM=ON`, install the WFST
dependencies with `scripts/build_itn_deps.sh`, and pass a TN grammar directory
such as `models/tn_configs` through `--tts.tn-model-dir`. The expected
multilingual layout matches ASR ITN: immediate language-named children such as
`en/`, `fr/`, and `vi/`, each containing `tokenize_and_classify.far`,
`verbalize.far`, and optionally `post_process.far`. A direct single-language
grammar directory and the older split `classify/` and `verbalize/` layout remain
supported. See [TTS text normalization](configuration.md#text-normalization) for
server, YAML, and offline runner examples.

## NanoCodec decoder

Hugging Face: [nvidia/nemo-nano-codec-22khz-1.89kbps-21.5fps](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemo-nano-codec-22khz-1.89kbps-21.5fps)
(no tokenizer is needed for the codec decoder).

Pull it independently with `nemo-speech pull nano-codec`. Pulling `magpie`
does this automatically because the two models must run together.

Run the default stack:

```bash
nemo-speech synthesize "Hello from Magpie Multilingual." --output output.wav
```

## Converting custom TTS checkpoints

The unified [`convert_model.py`](../../convert_model.py) entry point accepts
compatible local `.nemo` archives and extracted NeMo checkpoints. It defaults
to `--outtype f16` for MagpieTTS and NanoCodec; pass `--outtype f32` to retain
full precision. The converter is a source-tree Python tool and is not included
in native release archives; see [Model conversion](../model-conversion.md) for
environment setup.

```bash
python3 convert_model.py custom-magpie.nemo --outfile custom-magpie.f16.gguf
```

Conversion does not require `nemo_toolkit`. The optional
`scripts/tts/tokenize-magpietts.py` debugging helper does.

OmniVoice uses a separately pinned, license-aware two-file conversion. See
[OmniVoice](omnivoice.md) for exact downloads, hashes, conversion commands,
CPU/CUDA execution, voice prompts, streaming, and the multilingual release gate.

Once converted, point the server at them; see
[TTS configuration](configuration.md).
